# ReactNativeSeed

This repository is the one I intend to fork every time I start a new project. I plan to make a clean architecture with basic functionalities with a few libraires (Authentication, Splashscreen, Ionicons...)

Feel free to fork. Feel free to create issues for any problem you encounter or any comments you'd like to share.

## Installing and building the app
